Python vs. R: A Head-to-Head Analysis Uncovering Seasonal Trends in the FTSE 100 (2000-2025)
FTSE 100 Analysis Infographic - Work in Progress
ðŸš§ Project Status: In Development ðŸš§
This repository contains the source code for a single-page interactive infographic visualizing the historical performance of the FTSE 100 index.

Please note: This project is currently under active development. The structure is in place, and the core visualizations are functional, but it is not yet complete.

Current Features Implemented:
Core Structure: The single-page application layout is built with Tailwind CSS.

Data Simulation: The page is currently powered by a JavaScript function that simulates 25 years of FTSE 100 data, including seasonal trends and major market events.

Key Visualizations:

Long-term historical trend (Chart.js).

Monthly return distribution (Plotly.js Box Plot).

Average monthly returns (Chart.js Bar Chart).

Static Content: The narrative text and section headers are in place.

Planned Features & Next Steps:
Live Data Integration: Replace the current simulated data with a live connection to an actual data source or a static CSV file from the original analysis.

Enhanced Interactivity: Add interactive elements, such as tooltips with more detailed information or options to filter the date range.

UI/UX Polish: Refine the styling, color palette, and responsiveness for a more polished user experience.

Code Refactoring: Clean up and further comment the JavaScript code for better maintainability.
